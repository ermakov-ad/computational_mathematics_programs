# computational_mathematics_programs
It's a repository for programs with simple numerical model for calculation some physical process.
1. filtration_of_viscous_liquid - branch with program for
calculation distribution of viscous liquid (like oil) and example (taken oil parameters and calculated dependence pressure in layer on time).
2. 1D_shock_wave_distribution - branch with program for
calculation distribution of shock wave (the Riemann problem) in a 1D environment (like tube). Include 2 models - HLL and HLLC.
